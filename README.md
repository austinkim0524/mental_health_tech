The following repository contains the K-Nearest Neighbors method of analysis on a mental health in tech survey dataset I used for a school project. 
The KNN_Analysis.ipynb file contains the Jupyter Notebook version of the code and visualizations for the KNN analysis on the dataset. This file is contains code, visualizations and analysis of the dataset.
The KNN_Analysis.py file contains just the code for the pre-processing, coding, and visualizations for the KNN analysis on the dataset.
The CSV file is the Excel-based data spreadsheet from which this analysis is based on (can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)
